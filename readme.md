## Aquarium
A home automation project. 

The goal:

'To take sensor readings from the aquarium using hardware & Raspberry Pi, store
those readings and make them available via an API to a frontend, for example an
Android or iOS app'.

## Repo Structure (general idea of what goes where...)

### Hardware
The low level stuff, circuit information, physical assets.

### Backend
Database, server, API.

### Frontend
API consumer, GUI, client.

## Ideas

- Build process should be able to create DB, deploy necessary artifacts to the 
Pi.
